To push the code from Ansible Server to Node there are 3 way--
1. Ad hoc Command:- It's nothing, It is a simple linux command.
	There si no Idempotency. Ad hoc means, Its like a temporary header teacher,Whenever in our school there head master is missing then this post is handled by another teacher like a assistance head teacher, So, this type of work is done by ad hoc command..
- Ad-hoc commands are command which can be run indivisually to perform quick function.
- These Ad-hoc command are not use for configuration management and depolyment, because these command are of one time usage.
- The ansible ad-hoc commands uses the /usr/bin/ansible command line tool to automate a single task.
   
2. Modules :- Here we use YAML Language.YAML is Markup Language.
		Whenever we use a Single YAML script/command that is called Module. 

3. Playbooks:- Here we use YAML Language. But Whenever we use multiple YAML command that is called Playbooks.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
1. Ad-hoc Command:-
--------------------
- Go to ansible server
# su - ansible
# ansible demo -a "ls"  => To see the demo group files. Here -a means argument..
# ansible demo[0] -a "touch file.txt" ==> To create a file of 1st node of demo group
# ansible all -a "touch file.txt"   ==> To create file in all nodes
# ansible demo -a "ls -al" ==> To see hidden file
# ansible demo -a "sudo yum install httpd -y" ==> To install httpd package in demo group
	or
# ansible demo -ba "yum install httpd -y" ==> To install httpd package in demo group
# ansible demo -ba "yum remove httpd -y" ==> To remove httpd package from demo group


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Ansible Module :-
---------------------
- Ansible ships with number of module(called module library) that can be executed directly on remote hosts or through playbook.
- Your library of module can reside on any machine, there are no server, daemons or databased required.
** Where ansible module are stored?
=> The default location for inventry file is /etc/ansible/hosts

** How to handled Idempotency in Ansible Module or Playbook.
=> Whenever run module or playbook then setup module cheks the nodes in the backend whether this package is installed or not.


# ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present"  ==> To install httpd, Here -m means module and -a means argument, -b for sudo 
# ansible demo -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"  ==> To start the httpd
# ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=absent"	==> To remove the httpd
# ansible demo -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=latest"	==> To update the httpd
# ansible demo -b -m user -a "name=DevOps" ==> To create user 

# ansible demo -b -m copy -a "src=file4.txt dest=/tmp" ==> To copy the file from ansible server to node
# ansible 192.168.30.132 -m copy -a "src=file.txt dest=/home/ansible/Desktop" ==> To Copy the file 

# ansible demo -b -m command -a "ls" ==> Linux command used in module
# ansible demo -b -m command -a "mkdir Folder-1"

# ansible demo -m ping ==> To ping the hosts


# ansible demo -m setup ==> To get the detail information about node
# ansible demo -m setup -a "filter=*ipv4*" ==> To get the Ip info of nodes
