jenkins installation
step1:
Updating packages in apt 
sudo apt update

step:2
#Install Java because jenkins writtens on java

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

step:3

wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key |sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg

The gpg --dearmor command is used to convert the key into a format that apt recognizes.

step:4

Next, let’s append the Debian package repository address to the server’s sources.list:

sudo sh -c 'echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg] http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

sh means shell 

The [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg] portion of the line ensures that apt will verify files in the repository using the GPG key that you just downloaded.

GPG key is used for the encryption.
Encryption is an important way for individuals and companies to protect sensitive information

step5:

44.204.156.1 -- use your ip

step:10
